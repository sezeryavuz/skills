# validate-brief.sh — sanity-check a brief input for prompt-to-production
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/validate-brief.sh [path/to/brief.md]
#
# Default path: ./brief.md (then BRIEF/brief.md as fallback).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — brief found and passed all required checks (warnings allowed)
#   1 — brief found but failed a required check (e.g. too short to be useful)
#   2 — brief file not found at default or supplied path
#   3 — reserved for future use (argument or environment error)
#
# Output:
#   Human-readable findings on stdout. Each finding is prefixed:
#     [OK]      — passed
#     [WARN]    — non-blocking; the skill should surface in the Stage A soft confirm
#     [FAIL]    — blocking; must be resolved before Stage B begins
#
# Audit posture (see references/security-posture.md):
#   - The script reads the brief file only. It does not read other files.
#   - It does not make network calls.
#   - It does not modify any files.
#   - Every external command (wc, tr, grep, echo) is a standard POSIX utility.
#   - The script is short and meant to be readable top-to-bottom by an auditor.
#
# This script is intentionally simple. Its purpose is to give the skill a quick
# objective signal about brief quality. The skill resolves WARN/FAIL items via
# the Stage A soft confirm and NOTES-TO-ADMIN.md.

# Strict mode: exit on error, exit on unset var, fail pipeline on any stage failure.
